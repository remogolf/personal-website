# Technologies used:
* HTML
* JAVASCRIPT
* SVELTE
* NETLIFY
* NODE JS

Like most websites we are generating a HTML and Javascript file, which is served using netlify. For this we are using and existing framework. I have chosen to use Svelte due to its simplicity and being very close to vanila javascript and pure html. This makes it easy to structure and retrace projects.
