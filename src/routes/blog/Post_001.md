# How I created my personal Website
In this article I will be discussing how I built my personal website.
This will also act as a refrence for future projects.

## Overview:
The basic idea was to create a portfolio website, through which I can showcase myself and ongoing projects. It should also have a blogging section, where I can document and showcase personal projects.

## Technologies used:
* HTML
* JAVASCRIPT
* SVELTE
* NETLIFY
* NODE JS

Like most websites we are generating a HTML and Javascript file, which is served using netlify. For this we are using and existing framework. I have chosen to use Svelte due to its simplicity and being very close to vanila javascript and pure html. This makes it easy to structure and retrace projects.
